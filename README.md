# Visual Odometry

There is a large corpus of Image data set collected while drving a car nowadays such as Gray scale, RGB, Depth maps. Car is equiped with variety of sensors such as camera, lidars, radars etc. Estimating car's trajectory using these imformation is fun and challenging.

## Feature extraction

Starting point in visual odometry is extracting the key features from images and using a appropriate descriptors such as SIFT, ORB, SURF and BRIEF for further processing. 

## feature matching

Using these feature descriptors to perform feature matching in all the subsequent images.


## Trajectory estimation

Estimating camera motion between a pair of camera images.
